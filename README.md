# Neural-Network-architecture-
Implementing Neural Networks architecture from scratch in python 

This project demonstrates the complete implementation of a neural network from scratch in Python, covering the core concepts such as forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent. The network is built without using deep learning frameworks, allowing for a deeper understanding of how neural networks function at a mathematical level. Key features include handling of various activation functions, cross-entropy loss, and a focus on learning through experimentation. This is an ideal project for those looking to grasp the foundational mechanics behind modern machine learning models.
